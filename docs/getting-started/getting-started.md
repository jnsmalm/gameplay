# Getting started

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/jnsmalm/gameplay/releases/latest) 
of Gameplay.js and extract the files wherever you choose. Create a new file 
*cube3d.js* in the same folder.

*cube3d.js*

```javascript
const $ = require("gameplay/lib")

$.Game.init()

let camera = $.Camera.createDefault($.Game.window)
let shader = new $.BasicShader()
let cube3d = $.Assimp.createModelFromFile("docs/_content/cube3d.json", shader)

$.Game.draw = () => {
  shader.setView(camera.getView())
  shader.setProjection(camera.getProjection())
  cube3d.draw();
}

$.Game.update = () => {
  cube3d.transform.localRotation.rotateX(2)
  cube3d.transform.localRotation.rotateY(1)
}
```

Run the code with the gameplay script (which uses the bundled Node.js runtime). 
If everything has gone well you should see a spinning 3D cube.

```
% ./gameplay cube3d.js
```

## TypeScript

> TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language developed and 
maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds optional 
static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. 
Learn more about it at https://www.typescriptlang.org

It's recommended that you use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for several 
reasons:

- Really good code completion and intellisense
- Flexible as JavaScript but with optionally static type checks
- Catch many errors before running your application

To run the above example in Typescript you need to download the 
[latest version](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links) of TypeScript. 
It's also recommended that you download 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Then follow these steps:

1. Start Visual Studio Code and open the Gameplay.js folder
2. Create a new file *cube3d.ts* with the same contents as *cube3d.js*
3. Change the line `const $ = require("gameplay/lib")`to `import * as $ from 
"gameplay/lib"`
4. You will now get all the benefits (like intellisense) from using TypeScript
5. Open the terminal and type `tsc` (to compile) or `tsc -w` (to compile and 
continuously check for file changes)
6. TypeScript compiler should now have compiled *cube3d.ts* to *cube3d.js*
7. Run the script with the gameplay script `% ./gameplay cube3d.js`
