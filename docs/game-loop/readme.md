# Game loop

> A game loop runs continuously during gameplay. Each turn of the loop, it 
processes user input without blocking, updates the game state, and renders the 
game. It tracks the passage of time to control the rate of gameplay.

The above quote is from gameprogrammingpatterns.com. The `Game` module handles 
the boilerplate code needed to get the game up and running. It creates a window 
(needed for drawing graphics) and input devices. It also sets up the game loop 
which calls `update()` and `draw()` at specified intervals.

```javascript
import * as $ from "gameplay/lib"
```

The `Game` module has to be initialized with `init()` to create a window and 
start running the game loop.

```javascript
$.Game.init()
```

When drawing the objects in your game, set `draw()`. When `draw()` is called 
the default render target has been cleared using the color set using `clearColor` 
when initlaizing `Game`.

```javascript
$.Game.draw = () => {
  // TODO: Add your drawing code here
}
```

Set `update()` to process user input and control game state changes. 
`update()` takes parameter `elapsedTime` which is set to the number of seconds 
since last update.

```javascript
$.Game.update = (elapsedTime) => {
  // TODO: Add your update logic here
}
```

## Time step

The `Game` module supports two different time steps: fixed and variable.

In a fixed-step game loop, `update()` is called once the `targetElapsedTime` has 
elapsed. After `update()` is called, if it's not time to call `update()` again, 
it calls `draw()`. After `draw()` is called, if it is not time to call 
`update()` again, it idles until it is time to call `update()`. Target time 
(in seconds) between calls to `update()` can be set using `targetElapsedTime` 
when initializing the `Game` module. Default is 1/60th of a second (60 fps).

When using a variable-step game loop, `update()` and `draw()` will be called as
fast as possible. Note that this doesn't mean that the game will run any faster 
than using a fixed-step game loop.

A fixed-step game loop calls `update()` at a somewhat predictable rate while a 
variable-step game loop doesn't. Use `isFixedTimeStep` when initializing your 
game to choose which time step you want to use for your game.
