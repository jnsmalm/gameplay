# Documentation

The documentation is written like tutorials which are generated from actual 
source code. The code is written in TypeScript, which should be simple to 
convert into plain JavaScript if you would prefer that.

- [Getting started](getting-started/getting-started.md) - Get started and create 
a spinning 3D cube
- [Game loop](game-loop/game-loop.md) - Learn about the game loop and how you 
can easily use it 
- [2D sprites](2d-sprites/2d-sprites.md) - Draw 2D sprites
- [Drawing graphics](drawing-graphics/drawing-graphics.md) - Using vertex 
specification and shaders for drawing graphics
- [Playing sounds](playing-sounds/playing-sounds.md) Using buffer and source for 
playing sounds
- [Text/input](text-input/text-input.md) Draw text and handle input
- [Entity/component](entity-component/entity-component.md) How to use the 
entity-component pattern for structure

All the tutorials are applications that can run. For example, use the gameplay 
script to run the *getting-started* application:

```
% ./gameplay docs/getting-started/getting-started
```
